# Binary Transparency Log for [obfusk's f-droid repo](https://obfusk.dev/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=2A21B7FFC93B878724B1991C05DAE113C72B93A556C193F49B5D3342884798B7)

This is a log of the signed app index metadata.  This is stored in a
git repo, which serves as an imperfect append-only storage mechanism.
People can then check that any file that they received from that
F-Droid repository was a publicly released file.
